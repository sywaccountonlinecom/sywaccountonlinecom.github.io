        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">

            <li>
                <strong>Visiting the Official SYW Portal:</strong> When I logged in for the first time, I made sure to go directly to 
                <a href="https://www.shopyourway.com/credithub/overview" class="text-indigo-600">syw.accountonline.com</a>.  
                The secure connection and official interface immediately gave me confidence that I was on the right website.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Signing In Easily:</strong> Entering my username and password was simple. The login page is clean, fast, and easy to understand.  
                If you're a new user, the registration process guides you step-by-step without confusion.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> I enabled 2FA to add an extra security layer. Every time I sign in, I receive a verification code on my phone.  
                This ensures that only I can access my credit card account.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Checking My Balance & Transactions:</strong> The dashboard is designed very well—clear, simple, and organized.  
                I can instantly see my current balance, pending charges, available credit, and recent transactions.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Downloading Monthly Statements:</strong> I regularly download my statements in PDF format.  
                It helps me track spending, keep financial records, and compare previous months easily.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Making Payments Online:</strong> Paying my bill takes only a few seconds.  
                I even set up AutoPay so I never miss a payment or get late fees again.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Tracking My Rewards:</strong> The rewards dashboard clearly shows how many Shop Your Way points I’ve earned and how close I am to redeeming offers, gift cards, or discounts.  
                It motivates me to use the card more smartly.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Setting Up Alerts & Notifications:</strong> I enabled text and email alerts for payment reminders, statement availability, and reward updates.  
                These notifications help me stay organized and avoid missed payments.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Keeping My Account Secure:</strong> I always log out after browsing, avoid using public Wi-Fi, and ensure my browser is up to date.  
                These small steps keep my credit card account safe from unauthorized access.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Getting Support When Needed:</strong> Whenever I faced login or password issues, the SYW customer support team helped quickly.  
                They provide clear instructions for password resets, account unlocks, and general assistance.
            </li>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6">
            Overall, managing my SYW Credit Card online has been simple, secure, and extremely convenient.  
            With features like AutoPay, alerts, online statements, and reward tracking, the SYW Account Online portal makes financial management effortless.
